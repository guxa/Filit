# Filit
From the subject:
"Fillit is not about recoding Tetris, even if itâ€™s still a variant of this game. Your pro- gram will take a file as parameter, which contains a list of Tetriminos, and arrange them in order to create the smallest square possible.
Obviously, your main goal is to find the smallest square in the minimal amount of time, despite an exponentially growing number of possibilities each time a piece is added."

The allowed library functions are : exit, open, close, write, read, malloc and free.
All other functions that we use to complete the project have to be recoded by us. (like strdup, strlen etc.) 
Creating our own library functions is the first project of the program, so our library is included in the repository too.
